                        <p style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 13px;">Applicant understands and agrees that

                            Any deviation from the approved plans specifications or special conditions will cause
                            the permit to automatically terminate and become null and void. Applicant understands
                            and agrees that if applicant fails to conform to each requirement then applicant
                            authorizes De Anza Oaks Homeowners Association to have the work brought into

                            of bringing said work into compliance will be a personal obligation of the owner. Such
                            costs shall include the costs of construction, reconstruction, administration, fees,
                            attorney fees, experts and consultants charges, and court costs, if incurred. It is
                            also agreed that no work will (1) be initiated which will be a violation of any of the
                            provisions of the Association’s Declaration of Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions
                            or any applicable building code, (2) be an annoyance to any resident; or (3) increase
                            the cost of insurance maintained by the Association.</p>
                        <p style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 13px;">It is further agreed that, in the event
                            the application is approved, all maintenance, repair or replacement of the 
approved
                            item will be the sole responsibility of the lot owner, and further that any expense

                            subject to the applicant 
receiving all such necessary permits and approvals.</p>
                        <p style="font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 13px;">Applicant agrees to use licensed and
                            insured contractors for any and all installations or to make the Architectural
                            Committee aware when this is the exception. Applicant agrees to notify the
                            Architectural Committee upon 
completion of the project so the Committee may inspect
                            and determine compliance with each and all of the
 conditions of approval of the
                            application.</p>
