            body: "De Anza Oaks HOA Elections! 2018 DAO Board Elections - Call for Candidates Two Seats up for Reelection This year there are two Board positions up forreelection and so far, no one stepped forward to submit their candidature. We need people to run for the Board. It is critical for our HOA to have a functioning Board of Directors. We need 5 persons on the Board because that’s what our Bylaws require and because it’s extremely difficult to conduct HOA business with less (quorum at meetings is 3).If you care about our community and want to make an impact, please consider becoming a Board member, or talk to your neighbors and encourage them to get involved. We need your applications NOW. To submit your candidature, please fill out the questionnaire you received with the election notice and mail your completed form to Grayson Management*: De Anza Oaks Homeowners Association c/o Grayson Community Management 65 Washington Street, Suite 268 Santa Clara, CA 95050 You can also submit your application electronically to helpdesk@graysoncm.com. *You must be a deed recorded owner of one of the properties within De Anza Oaks to qualify. Please complete this process by Thursday, September 20 – we  really need to meet this deadline to allow for preparation and timely mailing of ballots. The Annual Meeting will be held at 7:00pm on October 23rd, 2018 at the Clubhouse. All homeowners are invited to attend. If you have any questions, please e-mail the management company at helpdesk@graysoncm.com or call 1-888-277-5580. Thank you, De Anza Oaks BOD This is a Publication of De Anza Oaks HOA",
